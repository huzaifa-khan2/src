//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
// Store a list of famous landmarks in an array
var landmarks = ["Eiffel Tower", "Taj Mahal", "Great Wall of China", "Statue of Liberty"];
// Print the array
landmarks.forEach(function (landmarks) {
    console.log(landmarks);
});
