//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    for (var _i = 0, magicians_1 = magicians; _i < magicians_1.length; _i++) {
        var magician = magicians_1[_i];
        console.log(magician);
    }
}
function make_great(magicians) {
    var great_magicians = [];
    for (var _i = 0, magicians_2 = magicians; _i < magicians_2.length; _i++) {
        var magician = magicians_2[_i];
        great_magicians.push("the Great ".concat(magician));
    }
    return great_magicians;
}
// Array of magician's names
var magicians = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Copperfield', 'Penn Jillette', 'Teller'];
// Calling make_great to modify the magicians array
magicians = make_great(magicians);
// Calling the function to show the modified names of magicians
show_magicians(magicians);
