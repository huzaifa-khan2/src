//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    for (let magician of magicians) {
        console.log(magician);

    }
    return great_magicians;

// Array of magician's names
let magicians: string[] = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Copperfield', 'Penn Jillette', 'Teller'];

// Calling make_great to modify the magicians array

// Calling the function to show the modified names of magicians
show_magicians(magicians);
